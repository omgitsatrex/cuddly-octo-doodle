        The course focused on HTML and JavaScript. These two methods for coding are relevant to web design. Being that the course is titled ‘Web Systems’, it was also a requirement to have a website up and running for the submission of assignments. This involved a bit of research as provider for the domain name (GoDaddy.com) was very ‘sale-sy’ about pushing its own content-management software instead of just allowing users to direct the host provider to whatever page they wanted hosted (For me, I had my website running off of GitHub Pages). Once we got the website running we started learning how to apply what we knew about HTML for the first few assignments. At first it was simple. Upload a page with and image, simple enough. Upload a page with form validation. We got into equation plotting which was our first time working with JQuery. The biggest challenge for many was swapping the code from jsfiddle.com over to our own website as JSfiddle has the JQuery libraries loaded in prior to any coding. Afterwards, a greater focus was made on working with JQuery. This is where some of the more challenging work began to appear, as JQuery can do things that regular JavaScript coders would struggle to do. At first it was simple enough. We used existing images of playing cards taken from the internet and applied a ‘drag and drop’ function to them via a what’s known as a selector (One of the biggest features of JQuery). We later learned how we can make layered animations within canvas using JQuery. I will say, as an aside, that just the raw javscript method for the animation was staggeringly complex in the amount of code used. It really put a perspective on how JQuery can be better for some situations. The biggest shift in thinking with JQuery was when it came to creating HTML elements straight from the JQuery selector itself. We had a list of objects created within the script of an HTML body, but to make appear, what the selector did was select an element that did not exist yet, apply attributes to this ‘non-existing’ element, and then appending the element to the end of the body on the web page. I am sure there are many more fascinating tricks to be learned with using JavaScript and JQuery. while my focus through earning my degree has been on IT Security, I gotta say I think I would like to explore the concept of web building a little more, and if that curiosity pays, even better. Looking online one of the positions available for hire would be a front end developer for <a href="https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=Web+Developer&vjk=11f4a2ec468f8626&advn=4407846845847026">Revature</a>. Looking at the description for this job they make it clear the biggest requirement is to have at least a 2-year degree. While the listing itself is not terribly specific about what skills are required, the concept of front-end development has been almost everything this course has been about, and given that there is also a mentoring program mentioned, it seems to be the most logical next step in one’s aspirations for web development. Another interesting posting came from <a href="https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=Web+Developer&vjk=784d5d433446c270">Vanguard</a>. Their listing indicates using Java with the AWS cloud. Though it is object oriented, Java is still very different from regular JavaScript. Nevertheless, the listing did not state any years of experience were needed, and that a college education would suffice. By looking at these postings and many more, I personally feel more confident than before in my own skills to be useful in the workforce, and am very grateful to have had this learning experience.
